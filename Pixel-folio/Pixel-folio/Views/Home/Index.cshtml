    <h3>About</h3>
    <h5>Learn a bit about me</h5>
    <p>
        I started my journey in the design area, having a degree in Multimedia and Graphic Design at ESAD.CR. I had the great opportunity to work in the videogames area, where I worked on Stellar Interface and Super Bunny Laser Spikes, mainly working as a graphic designer, animator, UX/UI and 2D artist. I've also worked on another title but it's still on development and date still to be announced.
        I also worked as a motion designer in an esports agency, Bitzer Esports.
        Now my professional journey is focused on the programming and developing software side, where I started in a program called UpSkill back in October 2020. I'm still currently learning the ropes and more will be updated here once time has traveled a bit more.
